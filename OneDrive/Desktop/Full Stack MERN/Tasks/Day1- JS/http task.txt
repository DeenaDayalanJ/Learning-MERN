HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and it is the basis for all the web applications.
HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send the information.

HTTP/1.1 was created in 1997 and HTTP/2 was created in 2015.

HTTP/2 is faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.

1. Multiplexing: 

HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cant be loaded, it blocks all other resources.
HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that one resource cant blocks any other 
resource. It's splitting data into binary code messages and numbering these messages so that the clients know which stream each binary 
message belongs to.

2. Server Push: 

A server only serves content to a client device if the client ask for it. And this approach is not always practical for the modern web 
pages, which often involve several dozen separate resources that client must request.
HTTP/2 solve this problem by allowing a server to push content to a client before the client ask for it. The server also sends a message letting the client know what pushed content to expect.

3. Prioritization:

Prioritization refers to the order in which pieces of content are loaded. Prioritiation affects a webpages load time. Certain resources
like large JavaScript files, may block the rest of the page from loading if they have to load first. More of the page can load at once 
if these render-blocking resources load last.
HTTP/2 Offers a features called weighted prioritization. This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time.
