JavaScript Object is a collection of named valus having state and behavior(properties and method).

Objects are important data types in javascript. Ojects are different than primitive datatypes (number, string, boolean). 
Primitive datatypes contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of key:Value pair.

Every Object has some propert associated with some value. These value can be accessed using these properties assocaited with them.

For Example:

var myCar = new Object();

myCar.make = 'Nissan';

myCar.model = 'GTR';

myCar.year = 2023;

myCar.wheels = 4;

After creating myCar Object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.



Syntax of adding a property to an object is:

ObjectName.ObjectProperty = PropertyValue;
