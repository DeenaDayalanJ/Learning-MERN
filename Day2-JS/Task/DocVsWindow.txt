

JavaScript uses two important objects in web development: document and window. 


Document Object:  It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy.

->Represents the loaded HTML page.

->Used to access and modify page content.

->Great for DOM manipulation.

->Helps with event handling within the page.


Window Object: Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. 
The document contains the contents of the page. 
Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page

->Represents the entire browser window.

->Controls browser-related actions.

->Manages global variables and browser functions.

->Handles events like resizing and unloading.
